# Working with DNS

## Which DNS domains (zones) can I control 
Each cluster is connected to an AWS account which has got one or more associated 
dns zones or domains. 

Each namespace you can control using your teams apps-repository can modify dns 
records within any zone in the zones clusters account. 

All available zones are listed in the `README.md` in the namespaces folder 
in the apps repository.

Domains for an account may change. Please act responsibly while working with DNS: 
there may be zones logically belonging to other teams also hosted in the 
same cluster. Please don't experiment with such zones. 

## How to control DNS.
### As part of IDP advanced chart
The most straightforward way to work with DNS is to use the idp-advanced chart
where it is possible to list the fully qualified domain names desired for hosting each 
service. When using these settings all aspects of DNS (and issuing of certificates) 
will be handled for you.  

### DNS records not belonging to a specific deployment. 
It is posisble to set arbitrary records in a given dns zone without 
the records being related to web services or other deployments inside the cluster. 

Here you can use the chart (`crossplane-route53-records`)[https://github.com/jppol-idp/helm-crossplane-route53]. 

This chart becomes relevant when you
- Want to create validation records of type `TXT`
- Want to prepare a migration by creating CNAMEs to deployments hosted outside IDP. 
- Want to setup MX records
- Need to perform actions not anticipated in this documentation :) 

In short: You can maintain DNS records inside IDP hosted zones for whatever purpose you want. 

Records can be created in one folder for all zones in the cluster, in one folder per namespace 
or in a folder pr "purpose". 

Each file contain a list of records referencing the domain ny name and setting values, type 
and ttl per recor 

### Examples 

Reference the chart `helm/crossplane-route53-records`

```
apiVersion: v2
name: Route53 zones
description: Crossplane mappings for Route53 zones available in the cluster
version: 0.1.0
slackChannel:
helm:
  chart: helm/crossplane-route53-records
  chartVersion: "1.2.4"
```

In the `values.yaml` file you can specify the needed records in the array `records`. 

Each record should reference a zone using hte attribute `zoneName`. Simply use 
the fully qualified domain name for any zone hosted in the cluster.

You must also provide a ttl (in secords), the actual values in the `revords` array and 
of course the record type in `type`. 

The `name` field should contain the subdomain part of a CNAME or A record. To create an 
Â´A` record pointing `dns-example.idp-test.idp.jppol.dk` to the ip address `1.2.3.4` you 
should use a record like 
```yaml
records:
  - zoneName: idp-test.idp.jppol.dk
    name: dns-example
    records:
      - "1.2.3.4"
    ttl: 120
    type: A
```
A full set of examples below. 
```
records:
  - zoneName: dev.login.jppol.dk
    name: _5c17921fdcbab1ebc28f32646927c36b
    records:
      - _65911f457be5b82b76a8545615fba045.zfyfvmchrl.acm-validations.aws.
    ttl: 60
    type: CNAME

  - zoneName: dev.login.jppol.dk
    name: _dmarc
    records:
      - "v=DMARC1; p=none;"
    ttl: 300
    type: TXT

  - zoneName: dev.login.jppol.dk
    type: MX
    name: mail
    records:
      - "10 unwvzosa6qxvts6hvy67d24cubur5g33.dkim.amazonses.com"
    ttl: 300

  - zoneName: dev.login.jppol.dk
    type: TXT
    name: mail
    records:
      - "v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all"
    ttl: 300
```

### Conflicting records
If you seta identical DNS records in both idp-advancd and the route53-chartIf 
you set a certain DNS in both idp-advancd and the route53-chart the system backing idp-advanced 
will compete with the systemn supporting route53. There is currently no detection of this.
